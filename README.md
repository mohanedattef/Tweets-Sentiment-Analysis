# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
**This repo is now deprecated due to the fact that twitter now monetizes the API usage, you can still use this if you pay for the service**    
In this project I use the nltk Naive Bayes Classifier with the 1.6 million Sentiment140 dataset found here:  
>https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140  
```
The process of training this model will take a while due to the nltk library being educational
and not really production scale 
I will be later looking into the same process using the tensorflow libraries but this works too.
