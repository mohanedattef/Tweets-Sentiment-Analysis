# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project I use the nltk Naive Bayes Classifier with the 1.6 million Sentiment140 dataset found here: >https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140  
```
The process of training this model will take forever due to the nltk library being educational and not of a production scale  
will be later looking into the same process using the tensorflow libraries but this works too.
